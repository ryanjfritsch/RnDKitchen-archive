Only 3/5 stars unfortunately. I am a huge peanut butter fan so I was really looking forward to making this pie. The Nutter Butter crust with the brownie filling was excellent, but was over-powered by the two layers of peanut butter whipped cream and normal whipped cream. I found that the two tastes evened out when I scraped some of the whipped cream topping off. The chocolate chips and peanut butter chips on top were a good addition to the topping and helped bring back some of the flavors of the middle of the pie. However, I don't think it helped enough. Next time I would make/use about half of the instructed peanut butter and whipped cream topping.
